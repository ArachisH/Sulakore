// The Unity message name will appear on the left, while the right side will provide the packet id.
// If mappable, the right side may also contain the Flash message name counterpart delimitted by a comma.
// The counterpart will be matched during runtime to ensure the API will map the messages correctly based on the revision of the Flash client.
// This will allow users/developrs to provide their own FlashMessages.ini which may differentiate between several flash client revisions. (Since the hashes of these messages may change between builds)
// Assigning a flash counterpart here will also allow developrs to use either message names while developing their modules.
// No spaces between the id, and the flash message name.
